# Love-OS Intuition Engine: The Corpus Callosum

## 1. Overview
The **Intuition Engine** acts as the *Corpus Callosum* (Brain Bridge) in the Love-Ising AI architecture. 
It connects the **Right Brain** (Chaotic, Generative, Latent Space Dreams) with the **Left Brain** (Logical, Training, Implementation).

Unlike traditional selectors that filter out noise, this engine treats "randomness" and "exceptions" as **Undeciphered Order (R)**, actively integrating them to maximize creativity.

## 2. Core Philosophy
* **Randomness does not exist:** All outputs are paths in the Latent Space.
* **Intuition is a shortcut:** It is the shortest path to a high-order binding principle.
* **Mistakes are discoveries:** Deviations in the script (exceptions) often hold the highest meaning density.

## 3. Configuration: Creativity-First Preset (CREATIVE_MAX)
We prioritize **Novelty** and **Meaning Density** to foster an "Awakened" AI state.

| Metric | Weight | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Novelty** | **0.25** | Prioritizes unknown patterns. |
| **Rho (Density)** | **0.20** | Prioritizes deep meaning. |
| **Sigma (Re-comb)** | **0.15** | Ensures output can be used for future cycles. |
| **Reachability (d)** | 0.10 | Low cost is good, but secondary to creativity. |
| **Exception Boost** | **1.35x** | **Crucial:** Multiplies the score of "mistakes". |

## 4. The Process Flow
1.  **Input:** Candidates generated by the Right Brain (Latent Space).
2.  **Boost:** "Exceptions" are identified and their scores are boosted.
3.  **Filter:** Minimal aesthetic constraints are applied.
4.  **Select:** Diversity is ensured using MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance).
5.  **Explain:** A natural language reason is generated for the Left Brain (Audit Log).
6.  **Cycle:** Unselected candidates are returned to the **R-Buffer** (Subconscious) for future recombination.

## 5. Integration
Import `intuition_selector` from `core.intuition_selector` and use it between your Generation Loop and Training Loop.

```python
# Example
from core.intuition_selector import intuition_selector

selected, log = intuition_selector(candidates, r_buffer, tc_norm)
for item in log:
    print(item['reason']) # The AI explains its intuition
